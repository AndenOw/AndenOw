        <p class="mb-4"><span class="pl-8"></span>Like economics states, people do things (at least mostly) out of self interest. And while some things can appear to be motivated out of something to the contrary, they can often be brought back to more selfish justifications. So, why would someone choose to make a free blog?</p>
        <p class="mb-4"><span class="pl-8"></span>I can’t speak for others, but I know at least some of the reasons I want to make this blog. Of course, there is the search engine optimization from having links back to my personal website, having something to put on my coding portfolio to advertise myself to recruiters, but the reason that stands out the most is idea exploration. I have a belief that, the more I explore and write down my ideas, the more distilled they become. I can think more logically, can explain my thoughts more effectively, and can sound like I know about some of these things just through writing them down and hopefully revising/editing them.</p>
        <p class="mb-4"><span class="pl-8"></span>I don’t expect to have any readers. I don’t expect to offer thoughts that can positively change a reader’s life. But, I do think that writing can help me, and it would be absolutely lovely if someone does end up getting help from something I write.</p>
