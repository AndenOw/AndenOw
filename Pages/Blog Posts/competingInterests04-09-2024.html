        <p class="mb-4"><span class="pl-8"></span>I’m not very inclined to believe in zero-sum games. If you look across history, the baseline of wealth and quality of life increases, as well as population. Everyone is gradually getting wealthier as technology is getting better, and I don’t see this trend stopping anytime soon.</p>
        
        <p class="mb-4"><span class="pl-8"></span>But there is one notable exception to this. Your time is a zero-sum game. Sure, you can implement light beds, supplements, genetic testing, cold plunges, exercise, clean diet, saunas, etc. but at least for now, you won’t live forever. Your life is a zero-sum game.</p>

        <p class="mb-4"><span class="pl-8"></span>I talk with my Stepdad a lot about systems to live your life under. He frequently brings me back to this quote:</p>

        <blockquote class="border-l-4 border-blue-500 pl-8 my-4">
            <p class="italic">“The problem is, you think you have time.”</p>
        </blockquote>

        <p class="mb-4"><span class=pl-8></span>I’ll leave that quote unsourced, but in my mind, it is attributed to my Stepdad. He goes further by saying, “Your time is a zero-sum game. Everything is a competing interest.”</p>

        <p class="mb-4"><span class=pl-8></span>The context of this particular conversation is that we were discussing why I can’t sleep consistently, and when I do, I don’t feel rested. We concluded that I am an edge case when it comes to sleep. Most sleep wisdom is built for the majority of the population, which is sedentary adults above the age of 25. I am none of these things. I am foremost a teenager, which brings its own set of extra sleep needs, but I also think a lot by self-teaching coding, and exercise a lot mostly by rock climbing (here is a link to why lazy people often get addicted to rock climbing). While exercise is typically thought of as a sleep aid, the overtraining that often occurs from long climbing sessions can necessitate even more recovery time.</p>

        <p class="mb-4"><span class=pl-8></span>All of that is to say: being a teenager, engaging in an intellectual pursuit, and possible overtraining are all competing interests to getting an adequate amount of rest with 8 hours of sleep. I never considered these things when I was being consistent with sleep, so I would only set aside 8 hours to be in bed. Therefore it shouldn’t have come as a surprise when I would feel sleep-deprived when I followed my schedule, and would always fall off the bandwagon.</p>

        <p class="mb-4"><span class=pl-8></span>I recently started a job as a coding instructor. So far, I’ve helped teach block coding (click and drag) to kids within Minecraft Education. And this set off a chain of events leading to me starting a family Minecraft server. It was all fun at the start (as it usually is). I was collaborating with my family who is typically away from home. The fact of it being a “family server” helped regulate me to not spend too much time or thought on it. But inevitably, it slowly fell apart. I won’t bore you with the details, but the worst it got was last night. I played from probably 3 pm to 5 pm, and then from 7 pm to 11 pm. What makes it even worse is that, while I could have been working on coding projects like I’ve been dreaming about, or building out my blog or personal website like I want to, my competing interest in both that and a reasonable bedtime was Minecraft.</p>

        <p class="mb-4"><span class=pl-8></span>Everything is a competing interest, and while you could have potentially infinite ambition and motivation, video games are designed to leech those so you spend more time on them. And unfortunately, in this case, I’m typically someone with high ambition, motivation, and obsessiveness. I was in denial of it at first, but video games are simply one of those things that take away resources from things more biologically important: sleep, exercise, and working towards a greater goal/purpose. And Minecraft in particular simply emulates the ideal person you would want to be in real life. You explore, terraform, build, conquer, hunt, gather, and overall make things more and more easy and efficient. One thing that Joe Rogan says that I like is “If you were an alien looking down on earth, the one thing you could say humans do is make things better and better over time.” I love the connection that Minecraft could bring me to my family when they are on the road, but I hate the way that it hacks into my drive to improve my life.</p>

        <p class="mb-4"><span class=pl-8></span>If there is one thing I want anybody to take away from this, it’s to think carefully about the way you spend your time. Time is the resource that your parents fought to give you. It’s the resource people built cities, healthy food, gyms, and medicine to protect. It is something that can tragically be taken away in an instant. There are so many mind-blowing things to see and do in this world, but to do them you have to choose carefully how you engage in them. Give the most you can to others. See all the things you want to. Experience the beautiful things life has to offer, but don’t get too sidetracked.</p>
